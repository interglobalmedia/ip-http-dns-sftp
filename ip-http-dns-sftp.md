    <h2 class="sentence">What is an IP address?</h2>
    
You don't ***need*** to ***know*** the ***ins*** and ***outs*** of an `IP address` to ***purchase*** `hosting` or a `domain name`, but ***learning*** more about ***what*** is ***going on*** behind the ***scenes*** of your `web site` is ***always*** a **good thing** to ***know***.

You can ***find*** `IP addresses` in `web browsers`, when ***setting up*** your `Wi-Fi` at ***home***, and ***even*** when ***building*** a `web site`.

`IP address` is ***short*** for `Internet Protocol address`, and is a ***string*** of ***numbers*** that ***usually*** looks ***something*** like the ***following***:

```shell
23.65.75.88
```
An `IP address` is ***similar*** to a `home address` in that it ***identifies*** the `location` of a ***specific*** server that's ***connected*** to the `Internet`. ***Without*** an `IP address` in ***place***, a `computer` ***can't*** `communicate` with ***other*** `computers` that are ***linked*** over a `network`, ***like*** the `Internet`.

***Every*** `machine` that is ***connected*** to a `network` will ***have*** an `IP address`. In ***this*** `case`, the `network` is the `Internet`. ***All*** `computers` that are ***connected*** to the `Internet` ***use*** the `TCP` (`Transmission Control Protocol`) `IP` (`protocol`) to ***communicate*** and ***send*** `data` ***between*** one another. ***Each*** `computer` on a `network` has a ***unique*** `IP address` that ***sets*** it ***apart*** from ***other*** `computers`.

This ***unique*** `identifier` makes `data transfer` ***possible***, ***plus*** it is ***integral*** when one is ***mapping*** (aka ***associating***) a `domain name` to one's `web site`.

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="sentence">How IP addresses work</h2>
    
***Every*** `domain` is ***associated*** with a ***particular*** `IP address`. ***These*** `domains` are ***translated*** to an `IP address` ***via*** the `Domain Name System` (`DNS`). The `DNS` is like a ***giant*** `address book`.

When a `user` ***types*** a `domain name` in their `browser address bar`, the `ISP` (`Internet Service Provider`) ***performs*** a `DNS` ***query***. The `query` ***looks up*** the `nameservers` that are ***associated*** with the `domain`, then ***forward*** the `user` on to the ***requested*** `site`. This ***happens*** within a ***fraction*** of a ***second***.

`IP addresses` are ***like*** someone's `home address`. They ***just*** are the `home address` of the `computer`. The `IP address` is ***analogous*** to a ***person's*** complete `home address`, and a `domain` is like a `"nick name"` for ***that*** `address`. i.e., Maria's house. It's a `"description"` of that ***address*** rather than the ***address*** itself.
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="sentence">How IP addresses are assigned</h2>
    
`IP addresses` are ***assigned*** and ***managed*** by the `Internet Assigned Numbers Authority` (aka `IANA`). It is a ***not-for-profit*** `organization` that ***handles*** `IP addresses` around the ***world***. They help ***partition*** out `IP addresses` on a ***regional*** basis to ***regional*** `directories`.

These ***regional*** `directories` then ***distribute*** the `IP addresses` to the `ISP`s and ***other*** `institutions` ***within*** their ***region***. Your `IP` ***address*** has probably been ***assigned*** by a ***local*** `ISP` or `network` that's ***in charge*** of ***managing*** the ***region***. This `process` ***ensures*** that `IP addresses` are effectively ***distributed*** and ***never*** assigned ***more*** than ***once***.

---

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="sentence">Different versions of IP addresses</h2>
    
Right ***now*** there are ***two*** `versions` of `IP addresses`. The ***first*** is ***called*** `IPv4` and the ***second*** `IPv6`. `IPv4` is the ***older*** `version`, and `IPv6` the ***newer***.

***Essentially***, `IP`s were ***upgraded*** to `IPv6` ***because*** there ***weren't*** enough `IP` `addresses` ***available***.

***Every*** `computer` ***connected*** to the `Internet` ***needs*** a ***completely*** unique `IP address`. ***Since*** the `Internet` has ***become*** a `"thing"`, there ***weren't*** enough `IP addresses` to go ***around***. That's ***despite*** the ***fact*** that `IPv4` ***supported*** over `4 billion` ***unique*** `IP`s. ***However***, these days, that does ***not*** sound like ***much***!

`IPv6`, ***however***, can ***support*** 340 trillion, trillion `IP addresses`.

</section>

---

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="sentence">Available Types of IP Addresses</h2>
    
There are ***public*** `IP addresses`, ***private*** `IP addresses`, ***static*** `IP addresses`, and ***dynamic*** `IP addresses`. The ***structure*** for ***all*** these `IP addresses` is the ***same***, just their ***purpose*** differs.

***Dynamic*** `IP addresses` ***change***. ***Static*** `IP addresses` do ***not***.

</section>

---

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="sentence">The public IP address </h2>
    
***Public*** `IP addresses` work ***outside*** of a ***closed*** `network`. This is the ***type*** of `IP address` that a `home network` ***uses*** to ***connect*** to the ***rest*** of the `Internet`'s ***devices***. The ***public*** `IP` ***lets*** you ***connect*** your `home computer` to an `ISP`, which then ***allows*** you to `access` ***other*** `web sites` around the ***world***, by ***communicating*** with the `servers` they are ***hosted*** on.
</section>

---

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="sentence">The private IP address</h2>
    
***Private*** `IP addresses` work in a ***similar*** way, but ***instead*** of ***connecting*** to the `Internet` as a ***whole***, it ***works*** on a ***closed***, `private network`.

A ***private*** `IP address` lets you ***do*** things like ***connect*** your `home computer` to a `wireless printer`, i.e. (I have that). ***Each*** `device` has its ***own*** unique `IP address` which can be ***used*** to ***communicate*** with a `home router` in your `private network`.

</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="sentence">IP addresses, domains, and web sites</h2>
    
The ***most*** `important` ***aspect*** of an individual's `IP address` is ***how*** it is ***related*** to their `DNS servers`. ***Without*** `DNS servers` in ***place***, we would ***have*** to ***type*** in `IP addresses` in `browser address bars` to ***access*** `web sites`.

</section>

---

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="sentence">How DNS system works</h2>
    
The `DNS` (`Domain Name System`) ***works*** like a `phone book`. It ***maps*** out `domain names` and their ***associated*** `IP addresses`.

When one ***types*** a `domain name` in the `browser address bar`, it ***communicates*** with the `DNS`  to ***find*** the `location` of the `server` the `web site` is ***hosted*** on ***via*** the ***associated*** `IP address` of the `remote server`. Then it ***gets*** the `web site`'s ***files*** and ***displays*** them in the `browser window`.

***However***, `IP addresses` go ***two*** ways. An `individual's server` (`hosting service`) has an `IP address`, but ***so does*** the `device` (i.e., `computer`) one is ***using*** to ***connect*** to the `Internet`. ***However***, the `IP address` ***assigned*** to the `individual's server` on the `hosting service` is ***static*** (it does ***not*** change), and the `IP address` ***used*** to ***connect*** to the `Internet` on the `individual's computer` ***can*** change (it's ***dynamic***).

One ***gets*** a ***new*** `IP address` wherever one ***joins*** a ***different*** `Wi-Fi network`. One ***might*** even get ***assigned*** a ***new*** `IP address` on one's `home network` if the `router` is ever ***reset***. This is ***all*** done `behind the scenes`, and ***nothing*** has to be ***done*** by the `individual`.

    <h2 class="sentence">Dedicated vs shared IP addresses</h2>
    
***Shared*** `IP addresses` are the ***most*** common when ***purchasing*** a `shared hosting plan`, but ***dedicated*** `IP`s are ***available*** for ***some*** (more expensive) `hosting plans`.

</section>

---

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="sentence">Dedicated IP addresses</h2>

***Dedicated*** `IP addresses` ***fall*** under ***dedicated*** `IP hosting`. With ***dedicated*** `IP hosting`, an `individual` is ***given*** a ***single*** `IP address` that is ***dedicated*** to ***their*** `site` and ***their*** `site` ***alone***. In ***other*** words, they have a ***single*** `IP address` for the ***physical*** `server` they are ***using***. `Individuals` can ***also*** have a ***dedicated*** `IP address` on `shared hosting`. That ***means*** not sharing an `IP address`, even though the ***same*** `physical server` is being ***shared***.

Let's [test out the following IP address](https://www.hostgator.com/blog/what-is-ip-address/) in the `browser address bar` and see ***where*** it ***takes*** us:

```shell
216.58.217.206
```

To ***learn*** about the ***benefits*** of having a ***dedicated*** `IP address`, please ***visit*** the ***blog post*** entitled [What is an IP address?](https://www.hostgator.com/blog/what-is-ip-address/) by `Kevin Wood`.

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="sentence">Shared IP addresses</h2>

***Shared*** `IP addresses` are ***more*** common than ***dedicated*** `IP addresses` for a ***number*** of ***reasons***.

With a ***shared*** `IP address`, there are ***multiple*** `sites` ***sharing*** the ***same*** `IP address`. This does ***not*** impact `users` ***visiting*** the `site`. The ***user's*** `web browser` will ***communicate*** with the `DNS` AND `server` to ***display*** the ***correct*** `web site`.

***Sharing*** an `IP address` does ***not*** necessarily ***mean*** that one is on `shared hosting`. It is ***possible*** to have a ***dedicated***, [VPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server) (`virtual private server`), or `cloud server`, while ***still*** having a ***shared*** `IP address`.

***Unless*** one needs the [unique benefits](https://www.hostgator.com/blog/benefits-dedicated-ip-hosting/) of a ***dedicated*** `IP address`, one can ***just*** `use` a ***shared*** `IP address`.

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="sentence">What is HTTP and how does it relate to a web site?</h2>
    
`HTTP` is a `protocol` (which is a ***set*** of `rules` ***governing*** the `exchange` or `transmission` of `data` ***between*** `devices`), which ***allows*** the ***retrieval*** of `resources` such as `HTML documents`. It is the ***foundation*** of ***any*** `data exchange` on the `Web` and it is a `client-server protocol`. `Client-server protocol` ***means*** `requests` are ***initiated*** by the `recipient`, ***usually*** the `Web browser`. A `complete document` is ***reconstructed*** from the ***different*** `sub-documents` which are ***fetched***, like `text` (`HTML`), `layout description` (`CSS3`), `images` (`assets`), `videos` (`assets` or `URL`s), `scripts`, and ***more***.

`Clients` and `servers` [communicate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview) by ***exchanging*** `individual messages` (as opposed to ***streams*** of `data`). The `messages` ***sent*** by the `client`, ***usually*** the `Web browser`, are ***called*** `requests`, and the `messages` ***sent*** by the `server` as ***answers*** to ***those*** `requests` are ***called*** `responses`.

The `HTTP protocol` has been ***around*** since the ***early*** `1990s`, and it has ***evolved*** over ***time***.

</section>

---

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="sentence">What kind of a protocol is HTTP?</h2>
    
`HTTP` is an `extensible protocol`. That ***means*** it was ***extended*** or ***expanded*** from its `initial state`. It has ***evolved*** over ***time***.

it is ***also*** an `application layer protocol` that is ***sent*** over [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) (`Transmission Control Protocol`) or ***over*** a `TLS-encrypted TCP connection`. The `TLS protocol` (***aka*** `Transport Layer Security`) is the ***next*** `version` of the `SSL` (***aka*** `Secure Socket Layer`) `protocol`.

As ***mentioned*** earlier, `HTTP` is ***not*** only ***used*** to ***fetch*** `"hypertext"` (`HTML`) `documents`, but ***also*** `images` and `videos`, or to ***post*** `content` to `servers`, like `HTML form results`. `HTTP` can ***also*** be `used` to ***fetch*** `parts` of `documents` ([AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)), ***aka*** `Asynchronous JavaScript and XML`) to ***update***.

</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="sentence">Components of an HTTP-based system</h2>
    
`HTTP` is a `client-server protocol`. `Requests` are ***sent*** by ***one*** `entity`, the `user-agent` (***aka*** `browser`) or a `proxy` on ***behalf*** of it. Even ***though*** the `user-agent` is ***usually*** a `web browser`, it can be ***anything***. It can be a `robot` that ***crawls*** the `Web` to ***populate*** and ***maintain*** a `search engine index` (like `Google`).

***Each*** `individual request` is ***sent*** to a `server` which ***handles*** and ***provides*** an `answer`, ***called*** the `response`. ***Between*** the `client` and the `server`, there a ***many*** `entities`, ***collectively*** called `proxies`, which `perform` ***different*** `operations` and ***act*** as `gateways` or [caches](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cache), for ***example***.

There are ***more*** `computers` ***between*** a `browser` and the `server` ***handling*** the `request`. There are `routers`, `modems`, etc. ***Because*** of the ***layered*** `design` of the `Web`, they are ***hidden*** in `network` and `transport layers`. `HTTP` is on ***top***, at the `application layer`. The ***underlying*** `layers` are ***mostly*** `irrelevant` to the ***description*** of `HTTP`. They are ***only*** `important` to ***diagnose*** `network problems`.

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="sentence">Client: the user-agent</h2>

The `user-agent` is ***any*** tool that ***acts*** on the ***behalf*** of the `user`. ***Usually*** the `user-agent` is a `web browser`. 

The `browser` is ***always*** the `entity` ***initiating*** the `request`.

To ***present*** a `Web page`, the `browser` ***sends*** an ***original*** `request` to ***fetch*** the `HTML document` that ***represents*** the `page`. It ***then*** `parses` (***analyzes*** `text` into its ***parts*** and ***describes*** their `syntactic roles`) ***this*** `file`, and `makes` ***additional*** `requests` for `execution scripts` (i.e., `JavaScript`), `layout` `information` (`CSS`) for ***display***, and `sub-resources` contained ***within*** the `page` (like `images` and `videos`). The `Web browser` then ***mixes*** `these resources` to ***present*** to the `user` a ***complete*** `document`, the `Web page`.

A `Web page` is a `hypertext` (`HTML`) `document`. This ***means*** `parts` of ***displayed*** `text links` which ***can*** be `activated` by the ***click*** of a `mouse` or `keypad` to ***fetch*** a ***new*** `Web page`, ***allowing*** the `user` to ***direct*** their `user-agent` and ***navigate*** the `Web`. The `browser` ***translates*** those ***directions*** into `HTTP requests`, and ***further*** `interprets` the `HTTP responses` to ***present*** the `user` with a ***clear*** `response`.

</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="sentence">The Web server</h2>
    
On the ***other*** `side` of the `communication channel` is the `server`, which ***serves*** the `document` as ***requested*** by the `client`. The `server` ***appears*** as ***only*** a ***single*** `machine` ***virtually***. This is ***because*** it may ***actually*** be a ***collection*** of `servers`, ***sharing*** the `load`, or a ***complex*** `piece` of `software` ***interrogating*** other `computers` (like `cache`, a `Database server`, or `e-commerce servers`), ***totally*** or ***partially*** `generating` the `document` on ***demand***.

A `server` is ***not*** necessarily a ***single*** `machine` (it ***can*** be ***many***!), but ***several*** `server software` ***instances*** (`applications`) can be ***hosted*** on the ***same*** `machine`. With `HTTP/1.1` and the `Host header`, they may even ***share*** the ***same*** `IP address`.

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="sentence">HTTP versions: HTTP/1.1</h2>
    
The [first version of HTTP](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec1.html), ***referred*** to as `HTTP/0.9`, was a ***simple*** `protocol` for `raw data transfer` ***across*** the `Internet`. `HTTP/1.0` ***improved*** the `protocol` by ***allowing*** `messages` to be in the `form` of ***MIME-like*** `messages`, ***containing*** `meta information` about the `data` ***transferred*** and ***modifiers*** on the `request/response` ***semantics***.

***However***, `HTTP/1.0` did ***not*** take into ***consideration*** the ***effects*** of `hierarchical proxies`, `caching`, the ***need*** for `persistent connections`, or `virtual hosts`. There was ***also*** a ***proliferation*** of `incompletely-implemented` (`unfinished`) ***applications*** calling themselves `"HTTP/1.0"`. It became ***necessary*** to ***modify*** the `HTTP protocol` in ***order*** for ***two*** `communicating applications` to ***better assess*** each other's ***real*** `capabilities`.

The `HTTP/1.1 protocol` ***includes*** more ***stringent*** `requirements` in ***order*** to ***ensure*** more ***reliable*** `implementation` of its `features` (***ensure*** `completion`).

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="sentence">The Host header</h2>
    
The `Host request header` ***specifies*** the `host` and `port number` of the `server` to ***which*** the `request` is being ***sent***.

if ***no*** `port` is ***included***, the ***default*** `port` for the `service` ***requested*** (e.g., `443` for an `HTTPS URL`, and `80` for an `HTTP URL`) is ***implied***.

The `Host header` ***field*** must be ***sent*** in ***all*** `HTTP/1.1` `request messages`. A `400` (`Bad Request`) [status code](https://httpstatuses.com/), for ***example***, may be ***sent*** to ***any*** `HTTP/1.1` `request message` that ***lacks*** a `Host header` ***field*** or that ***contains*** more ***than*** one.

`host`: `domain name` of the `server `(`address` of a `site`. It ***could*** be ***yours***!)

`port`: `TCP` (`Transmission Control Protocol`) `port number` on which the `server` is ***listening***.

<strong>Syntax</strong>:

```shell
Host: <host>: <port>
```

<strong>Example</strong>:

```shell
Host: developer.cdn.mozilla.net

    <h2 class="sentence">Proxies</h2>

There are ***many*** `computers` ***between*** the `Web browser` and the `server` which ***relay*** `HTTP messages`. ***Those*** `computers` are at the `application layers`, and ***along with*** the `HTTP client-server protocol`, are ***called*** `proxies`.

`Proxies` can be `transparent`, ***meaning*** that they ***forward*** `requests` they `receive` ***without*** `changing` ***them***, or `non-transparent`, which ***means*** that they ***do alter*** the `requests` ***before*** `passing them on` to the `servers`.

`Proxies` may ***perform*** `numerous functions` ***like***:

+ `caching` (i.e., the `browser cache`)

+ `filtering` (i.e., an `anti-virus scan` or `parental controls`)

+ `load balancing` (to ***allow*** `multiple servers` to `serve` the ***different*** `requests`)

+ `authentication` (to ***control*** `access` to ***different*** `resources`)

+ `logging` (***allowing*** the `storage` of `historical information`)

    <h2 class="sentence">Why HTTPS instead of HTTP?</h2>
    
`HTTP` (the `Web`) has ***become*** `central` to ***everyone's*** `daily life`. `HTTP` is the ***primary*** `protocol` for `applications` ***used*** on `computers`, `tablets`, `smart phones`, and ***other*** `devices`.

As our ***dependency*** on the `Internet` has ***grown***, so has the ***risk*** to `user privacy` and `safety`.

Every ***unencrypted*** `HTTP request` ***reveals*** `information` about the `user's` ***behavior***, and the `interception` and `tracking` of ***unencrypted*** `browsing` has ***become*** a `"thing"`.

***Today***, there is ***no such thing*** as ***non-sensitive*** `web traffic`.

When ***properly*** `configured`, `HTTPS` can ***provide*** a ***fast***, ***secure*** `connection` that ***offers*** the ***level*** of `privacy` and `reliability` that `users` should ***expect*** from `web servers` ([including and especially government ones](https://https.cio.gov/everything/)).

***According*** to the `HTTPS-Only Standard`,

> By always using HTTPS, web services don’t have to make a subjective judgment call about what’s “sensitive”. This leaves less room for error, and makes deployment simpler and more consistent.

It goes on to ***say***

> Web browsers can begin displaying HTTPS connections as normal, and HTTP connections as non-secure. HTTPS validation failures can become more strict, reducing the effectiveness of phishing and user error.

And ***finally***,

> These changed expectations improve the security of HTTPS on every website. In other words, protecting less sensitive sites strengthens the protections of more sensitive sites.

Be ***wary*** of ***landing*** on an `HTTP-driven` ***site***, and don't ***ever*** use `HTTP` yourself. Use `HTTPS`. And if you are an` e-commerce site`, be ***especially*** diligent in ***implementing*** `HTTPS`. ***Otherwise***, you will have `0` ***traffic***!

    <h2 class="sentence">SFTP instead of FTP</h2>
    
In the ***beginning*** `days` of the `Internet`, `FTP` (***aka*** `File Transfer Protocol`) was a ***popular*** but ***unencrypted*** `method` of ***transferring*** `files` between ***two*** `remote servers`.
